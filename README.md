# Reverse Engineering Job Descriptions
Herein, I create a flexible analytics environment where I can list the skills prospective employers are seeking and then practice them in the same space. Over time, I will put together a body of work that reflects the outline of my learning journey.

The Google Collab Notebook in this repository is the best place to see the work. I will update this readme along the way as I make progress.

## Journal Entry in a Long Abandon Project
### **2/27/2024** 
I landed the Senior Data Analyst I role with Bluelabs Analytics. However, I never did fill in the blank spaces I created in the jupyter notebook to demonstrate those skills, but I did land the job. I failed the portfolio project successfully in the end I guess. That said, this project is officially done in my book effective 2/27. If I close the chapter on this, I can start another anew.
